You wake up on Monday with the inexplicable feeling that something is off. You somehow feel vulnerable this morning. Targeted, like a sitting duck. Like some kind of wide-eyed, blathering infinity is staring you down, and you're powerless under the moronic heat of its Sauron-like thousand-yard gaze...

Oh, well. 
Shaking off the vibe, you depart for the big day you've got planned. Travel, family, the works. What could go wrong?

What, indeed.
Welcome to an introvert's nightmare.
The worst day ever.
Personal Space Invaders.



How to Play:

- Get out of uncomfortable conversations as fast as possible without being rude!
- You must use a word from the required list in each reply
- If your conversation partner gets too close or too angry, that's bad!
- If your conversation partner gives up and leaves, that's good!
- Good luck getting through the whole day -_-;



FAQ

Is this game scripted?
About a third is scripted â€” the moment-to-moment AI reponses are all prompted instead, and will change with every play.

Doesn't that cost money?
Yes. But we love u so happy birthday :)

Wait, how am *I* the rude one? They're being rude too!
Ain't that the truth. People like that seem to be playing by a different rulebook than the rest of us.
